# Kai's Organizer

### Why did I make this? Aren't there better calendar/organizational apps already?
I built this website in a blind rage.<br>
Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I was feeling very unhappy with the way my school gave out assignments.<br>
They use this awful assignment center app that none of the professors know how to use, and even if they did it wouldn't matter because half of them use third-party assignment apps because of some backroom deal they have with whatever textbook company offers them the most commission money to force their students to buy textbooks that give access to their proprietary assignment software that's required to pass the course.<br>
\*inhales\*<br>
Anyway.<br>
Every weekend I open up 11 tabs (yes, exactly 11 tabs. I counted. I'm very good at counting), throw all my assignments into the calendar section of this website, plan out when I'm going to start and finish them, and then I don't have to worry about it for the rest of the week.<br>
Unrelated, I also start a lot of projects that I never get finished, yet somehow I never know what to work on. For example, I started this project because I was procrastonating another personal project, which I started because I was procrastonating homework, which I was working on while I'm at work. Anyway, I just needed this website, and if anyone else has the same special brand of whatever disorder makes me like this, then you're welcome.
